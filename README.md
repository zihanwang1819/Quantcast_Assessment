This is a Java Progream, the command line is slightly different as required, you should put "java" at the head of commandline and put a ".java" after "most_active_cookie" to run the cmd line.

For example:
java most_active_cookie.java cookie_log.csv -d 2018-12-09              

java most_active_cookie.java cookie_log.csv -d 2018-12-08
